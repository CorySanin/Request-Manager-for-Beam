# Request Manager for Beam
Queue up a list of things your viewers on Beam.pro want you to do.

Request Manager is a simple Java application that can keep track of every button push on your Beam.pro stream. Let your viewers decide what you do next and keep track of all pending requests in a simple interface. Connecting to Beam couldn't be easier. Just [download the jar](https://github.com/CoryZ40/Request-Manager-for-Beam/releases), set up the default.ini file, and start up the program. There's nothing to it, honest!
